<p><span style="font-size: 20pt; font-family: 'Arial', Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Short introduction: </b></span><br>  
<span style="font-size: 16pt; font-family: 'Arial', Helvetica, sans-serif;">In numerous real-world scenarios, problem-solving tasks often involve multiple conflicting objectives. 
For example, in neural architecture search (NAS), the goal is to automatically find the best architecture of a neural network that balances multiple objectives, such as maximizing accuracy while minimizing the model complexity. 
  This is inherently a multi-objective problem because improving one objective (e.g., accuracy) often leads to a deterioration of another (e.g., model complexity). 
Traditional methods, such as the weighted sum approach, are often used but have significant drawbacks: the choice of weights is subjective, and multiple runs are required to find a set of trade-off solutions. 
  This tutorial will guide attendees from the fundamentals of multi-objective optimization to modern, population-based solutions. First, we will use practical examples to clearly demonstrate the differences between single-objective and multi-objective optimization.
  Next, we explain some basic concepts of multi-objective optimization such as Pareto dominance relation, Pareto optimal solutions, Pareto fronts, and non-dominated solutions. Then, we explain traditional approaches in the MCDM (multi-criteria decision making) field where a single final solution is found. 
Finally, we explain population-based approaches in the EMO (evolutionary multi-objective optimization) field. We will also briefly explain some hot research topics in the EMO field. </span></p>
