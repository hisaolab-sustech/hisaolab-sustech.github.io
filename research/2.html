<p> Recently, the use of evolutionary computation in machine learning has attracted considerable interest. In general, evolutionary computation can be used as optimization methodologies for various problems in machine learning. Some examples include the use of evolutionary computation for neural architecture search, reinforcement learning, genetic fuzzy classifier, etc.Â   </p>
